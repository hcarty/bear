Name:          bear
Version:       0.0.0
Synopsis:      Bare essential additions to the stdlib
Description:   The Bear library is meant to be a very minimal extension to the
               OCaml stdlib.  The feel of the library is meant to stick closely
               to the stdlib.  If functionality is available from another
               minimal library (ex. Rresult, Sosa) then it should be out of
               scope for Bear.
